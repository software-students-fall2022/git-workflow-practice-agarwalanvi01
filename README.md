## Article on the Ethics of A.I. Generated Art
### link to article: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html

I found this article interesting because it brought up questions about how new software and technology interact with art, as well as  what constitutues art in general. The author compares the use of A.I. generating visual art from text inputted by the user to other technologies, such as photography and digital editing tools, which were originally met with a similar amount of backlash and criticisms that they should not be considered "real art". But, the ethical dilemmas of A.I. generated art, primarily the issue of plaigarism, distinguish it from past technologies. I find it difficult to credit an artist who produces a piece using one of these image generators, as although the idea in the text they write is technically theirs, the image is produced using references from all art from any artist that is available online. Although one could argue that it's similar to taking inspiration from the work of others, to me it seems to cross a line, and I wonder what use of these technologies means for the state of visual art in the future.

I thought this was a really interesting piece on the intersection of software and art, and I really appreciated your take on the ethical dilemmas regarding using AI to generate art.
